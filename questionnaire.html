            <h1>Redberry Origins</h1>
            <p>You watch “What? Where? When?” Yeah. Our founders used to play it. That’s where they got a question about a famous American author and screenwriter Ray Bradbury. Albeit, our CEO Gaga Darsalia forgot the exact name and he answered Ray Redberry. And at that moment, a name for a yet to be born company was inspired - Redberry 😇</p>
